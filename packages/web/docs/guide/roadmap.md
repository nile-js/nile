# Roadmap

What's coming next for Nile.

---

- **WebSocket Transport** — Real-time bidirectional communication using the same service/action model. Subscribe to action results, push notifications.
- **Streaming Responses** — SSE and chunked transfer for long-running actions (AI completions, large dataset exports).
- **Performance Benchmarks** — Formal benchmark suite measuring O(1) action dispatch, throughput comparisons against endpoint-based frameworks (Express, Fastify, NestJS), and Bun vs Node runtime performance across real-world workloads.
