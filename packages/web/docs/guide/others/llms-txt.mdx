## Context7 MCP

Nile is indexed on [Context7](https://context7.com/nile-js/nile) — an MCP server that feeds up-to-date library documentation directly into AI coding assistants. Any AI tool with Context7 MCP support (Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, Claude Code, etc.) can pull Nile's full documentation into context while generating code.

This means your AI assistant already knows how to work with Nile — services, actions, hooks, auth, uploads, the client SDK — without you needing to paste docs or explain the framework.
