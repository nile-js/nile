## Guide

- [Getting Started](/nile/guide/start/getting-started.md): Installation, basic setup, and your first Nile server
- [Actions](/nile/guide/basics/actions.md): Actions are the core building blocks of Nile. Each action represents a single operation that can be called via the REST-RPC interface.
- [Services](/nile/guide/basics/services.md): Services group related actions together. A service is a logical container that organizes your actions under a common namespace.
- [Context](/nile/guide/basics/context.md): NileContext provides access to request context, session data, and shared resources throughout your application.
- [Interacting with Nile](/nile/guide/basics/interacting.md): Nile exposes a single HTTP endpoint for all interactions. All requests are POST requests with a JSON body that specifies the intent, service, action, and payload.
